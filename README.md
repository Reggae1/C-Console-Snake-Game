**🐍 C# Console Snake Game**
This is a classic implementation of the Snake game built as a console application using C#.

**🕹️ About the Project**
Relive the nostalgia of the classic arcade game directly in your terminal! This project provides a complete and functional version of Snake, featuring:

Simple Console Graphics: Utilizes basic console characters (#, @, *, etc.) for rendering the game environment.

Intuitive Controls: Uses the arrow keys for smooth direction changes.
